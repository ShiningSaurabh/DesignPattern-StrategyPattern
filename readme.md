Strategy pattern is used when we need different runtime
implementation for one purpose.

In strategy pattern, an interface is used which is the base strategy , 
we have context classes which implements this strategy according
to different use cases, and we have concrete class in which the required cotext
class is injected via constructor or any other method.
